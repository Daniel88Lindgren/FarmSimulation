//The simulator were supposed to be a VG task but i didn't get all code right in different classes so this is a G task with some more advanced code in it.


//Welcome to the adventure of Farm Simulator!
//In this program you can make different actions from the menu such as:
//Look at all crops and their quantity, Add new crops with a specified amount. You can also remove an unnecessary crop from the farm.
//Look at all animals and what they are eating. Add new animals with a specific fed type to make the animal as happy as can be! You can also remove any animal from the farm.
//If you have any future question or suggestions please report.
